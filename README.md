# AAA
Alien Aztec Adventure

AAA is a text-based adventure game coded in Java.

This game began with a project from a textbook called Objects First with Java, by David J. Barnes and Michael KÃ¶lling.

It was a very simple framework for an adventure game. 
In this version, there were a few rooms and the ability for a player to walk between these rooms. 
There was no user interface.

AAA is a version that has been heavily improved, modified and extended.

Additions include = 
- many more locations 
- items
- commands to handle items
- item creation/combination and the construct command 
- locations having dynamic events 
- a visual interface to ease gameplay 

This program was developed in the BlueJ IDE

This game was made by me, David Charkey.
