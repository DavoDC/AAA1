# AAA
Alien Aztec Adventure

AAA is a text-based adventure game coded in Java.

The "base" code for this application was project part of the material for the book:
   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Fifth edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael KÃ¶lling
   Pearson Education, 2012

It was a simple framework for an adventure game. In this version, there were a few rooms and the ability for a player to walk between these rooms. There was no user interface.

AAA is a version that has been heavily improved, modified and extended.

Additions include = 
- many more locations 
- items
- commands to handle items
- item creation/combination and the construct command 
- locations having dynamic events 
- a visual interface to ease gameplay 

This program was developed in the BlueJ IDE

This game was made by me, David Charkey.
