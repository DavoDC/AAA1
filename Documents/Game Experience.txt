“You: Where am I? … “ 
“You: I was supposed to awake from cryosleep on my home planet” 
“You: Something must have happened to Xadu” 
“Xadu: Kaxo, I crashed when a solar flare damaged my electrospacemotor circuits”
“Kaxo: Xadu! You surprised me! I’m so glad you’re still alive!”
“Xadu: I do not dissipate that easily, my friend”
“Kaxo: You must be quite hurt though. It seems will we need some conductive material to repair you”
“Xadu: Indeed. This rich planet is bound to have some. Have a look around”
A red exclamation mark appears on the HUD. You click on the book/quest button. You have new quest. It is represented by a gear on the left. The preview says “We need a conductive material to repair the ship. Have a look around!”.
After Kaxo, when Kaxo walks up to Xadu, an “Interact” button comes up. When clicked on, or Q is pressed, Xadu says “Found any conductive material yet?”, then you say: “Not yet”.
Kaxo walks around and realizes he is surrounded by rock. He finds some gold pieces near a shrine. The quest preview changes to “Keep finding more conductive material. We have 2% of what we need”.
After going back to Xadu with the gold,  and interacting with him,
Xadu says “This is perfect! With a significant amount of this, we will back home in no time!”.
Kaxo says “Great!. I need some help though. The area is surrounded by rock!”
Xadu says “I’ll apply a psionic lifter to one of them. That should help”
Kaxo says “Great idea. Thankyou”
