1. Understand code
 - Do commenting
 - Test in BlueJ if necessary

Add code = if audio was null = "System .out.println "its likely the libraries are missing"

2. Abstraction
- FileProcessor = base
- "Drawer" and "Speaker" inherit from it
- make util classes "FileIO" and "Drawer"
- FileIO uses working + most optimized way to get inputstream/widely used thing
 - Object is made for each class that needs it
- Drawer can draw shapes and images

2. Learning + Doing something useful at same time
 - Generate map using Tiled
 - Get AAA to use it


4. ... to be decided...
