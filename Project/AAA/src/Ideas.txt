Remove old GUI (buttons and images)

use diamond hunt as base?
Organise like diamond hunt?

add sparkling stars to menu

need draw cirlce, draw rect , draw image

Add image/spritesheet fields to Player, item Room, etc


Always one jframe that cleared and updated

Make frame object and get method

Test theory that drawing instead of using objects will be faster on minigame
(use draw circle btw)


Organise code into folders = 
Game = Player, items, rooms
AV = drawing, Frame
Minigames?

Walking up to items shows description
There is an option to grab it

Enemy encunter =  Do coloured shift with rectangles
Image on scren in front of exits

HUD  health on left
menu top left = fade to new image = save, load, quit, about setttings, help

Use of items
- Best weapon automatically equips
- Intelligent heal = (every time get down to 80, use 20 potion etc.)
(if get down to 50, use 50 item)

Take out print statements


Add highscore feature
= time completed + health lost = deduct from large number?


MiniGame ideas (no new window!)
- Topdown ones
  - jaguars chasing
  - snake boss that spits
  - small snakes
  - villagers with spears
- Puzzles
 - elemental stones - special room (pressure stones or frame close up)
- Side on
  - stalactites falling
