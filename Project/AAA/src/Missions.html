<b> URGENT </b>
Executable isn't working!
Try adding libs directly 


<b> Great GUI  </b>
- Link escape key to pause state
- Add 'help' state
- Write helper class
- Add 'about' state
- Add HELP and ABOUT to Mainmenu + Pause
- Add CREDITS to mainmenu
	- Add its + use translate , to make things move up gradually
	- when gets to certain level, reset to "0"



<b> Super Duper Map </b>
- Make "TiledMapPlus" class, which can handle collision
- Stop player from walking out of map



<b> Ye Be Faring  </b>
- HUD  health on left
- menu top left = fade to new image = save, load, quit, about settings, help
- popups that come up after landing on invisible triggers
  - 
  - "Electrospacemotor circuits must have melted..."
  - pause
  - "I need to find some conductive material for replacement"


<b> One Man's Junk... </b>
- Item class
- ittems will be image layer
- record XY manually
- invisible rectangle around for collision
- Walking up to items shows description
- There is an option to grab it
- Inventory system



<b> Ideas </b>
- Overlay class can write popups and hud 
 -later = popup uses timer to draw letter individually
- Enemies have an image
- Encounters involve a "text battle"
- if weapon good enuf, pass
- Items are invisible, make cross-rotate flashes to indicate where they are
 - make real obvious at start
 - first time
 - "Appears to be something here, press D to dig" 
 - "Gotta keep an eye out for these"
- First time enemy
- you've found an enemy + move back plyer forceably!
- make sure you're equpped to dealw tih

- A global lives system


<b> Event Spots </b>
- Enemy encounter =  Do colored shift with rectangles
- Image on screen in front of exits
- Use of items
- You need a conductive material score of 50
 - Record and show somewhere
 - Big is 25, few coins is 5, one coin = 1
- Best weapon automatically equips


<b> Minigames </b>
- Java slick2d underworld = in Google = great example!
- Intelligent heal = (every time get down to 80, use 20 potion etc.)
(if get down to 50, use 50 item)
- Minigames change score
- Topdown ones
  - Jaguars chasing
  - snake boss that spits
  - small snakes
  - villagers with spears
- Puzzles
 - elemental stones - special room (pressure stones or frame close up)
- Side on
  - stalactites falling
  
  
<b> Competition Factor </b>
- Add high-score feature
- time completed + health lost = deduct from large number?


<b>Error Handling </b>
- Add error popups
- Find out best place for "libs deleted" issue (where does it hit first?)
- Email "AAAdevteam@gmail.com" for errors


<b>Main Menu Effects </b>
- Programmatically add "Alien Aztec Adventure" title to menu
  //draw Big A + sound ?
        // pause
        // draw Big A + sound ?
        // pause
        // draw Big A + sound ?
        
        //write in "lien", "ztec" , "dventure"
        //pause
        //draw menu
