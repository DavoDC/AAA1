<h1> AAA Development Areas </h1>

<pre>
<text>


<b> General </b>
- Try to get a simple game out soon!  (Extend later!)


<b> Menu </b>
- Functional for now
- GameOver will need an edit when minigames ready

<b> Map </b>
- Functional for now

 
 <b> HUD  </b>
- Draw RELATIVE to player .. so can never touch
- Stats on Top left = FPS, mem, xy
- 3 lines on Top Right = takes back to mainmenu
- Show "lives" - represented by gold hearts
- Overlay class can write popups and hud 
- later = popup uses timer to draw letter individually
- Visible inventory system
- Walking up to items shows description
- popups that come up after landing on invisible triggers
  - "Electrospacemotor circuits must have melted..."
  - pause
  - "I need to find some conductive material for replacement"




<b> Items </b>
- Item class
 - Fields
  - SpriteLoc
  - Status 
  - XPos
  - YPos
 - Constructors
  - only used in static method
  - initialises all fields
 - Methods
  - Play init = initialiseItems( static)
  - Play update = check for item finding
  - Play render = item.renderAll()
- ListIterator class
- Items are invisible, make cross-rotate flashes to indicate where they are
 - make real obvious at start
 - first time
 - "Appears to be something here, press D to dig" 
 - "Gotta keep an eye out for these"
- Collision Implementation 1
	- items will be in items tile layer
	- log xy upon collision
	- compare to arraylist of "X-Y" strings
- Collision Implementation 2
	- player requires circle around him for collision
	- items have circles or rectangles arround them
	- record XY + draw rectangles manually
	- invisible rectangle around for collision
- There is an option to grab it
- Underlying Inventory system = arraylists


<b> Events </b>
- Event may be :
 - Item encounter
 - Quest start
 - Enemy encounter
 - Cinematic
- Update
 - Command strings generated by map collisions + comparison with database
 - Command is parsed 
 - Change boolean in hashmap
- Render
 - Checks all booleans 
 - Draws if true
 



<b> Enemies </b>
- HashMap
 - String = identifier
 - String = X-Y
- Add lives to globals 
- Enemy encounter
 - enter a different state
- Make enemie system simple at first
	- Enemies have an image in front of exits
	- Become visible only when you get near
	- Move player back forceably on first encounter
	- Encounters involve a "text battle"
	- If holding a weapon good enough, pass


<b> Quest System </b>
- HashMap
 - String = identifier
 - String = X-Y
- Quest system .. gold one is always there etc. .. q mark first?  .. becomes pic of gold
- On HUD, score out of 50 (Big is 25, few coins is 5, one coin = 1)


<b> Minigames </b>
- Java slick2d underworld = in Google = great example!
- Intelligent heal = (every time get down to 80, use 20 potion etc.)
(if get down to 50, use 50 item)
- Minigames change score
- Topdown ones
  - Jaguars chasing
  - jaguars leap
    - smaller area to move in
	- dark jungle outer area
	- jaguars pause at edge, then "leap"
  - snake boss that spits
  - small snakes
  - villagers with spears
- Puzzles
 - elemental stones - special room (pressure stones or frame close up)
- Side on
  - stalactites falling


<b> Optimization </b>
- look for reused resources, change to "global 
  
<b> Competition Factor </b>
- Add high-score feature
- time completed + health lost = deduct from large number?


<b>Error Handling </b>
- Add error popups
- Find out best place for "libs deleted" issue (where does it hit first?)
- Email "AAAdevteam@gmail.com" for errors
